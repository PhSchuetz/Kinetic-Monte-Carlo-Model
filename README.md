# Kinetic-Monte-Carlo-Model
This is a simple Kinetic-Monte-Carlo model that describes the growth dynamics of ternary perovskite oxides (ABO<sub>3</sub>) along the (100) crystal direction during Pulsed Laser Deposition and simulates the intensity of the specular Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) signal in the step density model. 

In particular, this model is designed to describe the growth of materials like SrIrO<sub>3</sub> or SrRuO<sub>3</sub> with an unstable B-site surface termination. When grown on an A-site-terminated substrate (e.g. TiO<sub>3</sub>-terminated SrTiO<sub>3</sub>), conventionally, a A-side terminated film structure would be expected. However, if the B-cation is prone to the formation of a volatile compound upon over-oxidation (e.g. IrO<sub>3</sub> for SrIrO<sub>3</sub> or Ru<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/RuO<sub>4</sub> for SrRu<sub>3</sub>) a termination conversion to an A-site termination can be observed during growth. Depending on the substrate temperature and oxygen partial pressure this conversion may stretch over the time needed for the deposition of one or several atomic monolayers. This model was designed to simulate the effect of this conversion onto the observed intensity oscillations of the specular RHEED signal during growth.

The basic idea of the Kinetic-Monte-Carlo simulation was adopted from the following publications:

## The model
A solid-on-solid model is adopted, which allows neither vacancies nor overhangs. The substrate is represented by a simple cubic lattice, described by a NxN matrix A. The entries a<sub>i,j</sub> describe the height of the lattice at side (i,j). Periodic boundary conditions apply, i.e. (i,j) = (i+N,j) = (i, j+N). The AO-BO<sub>2</sub>-AO-BO<sub>2</sub>-... sequence of perovskite materials along the (100)-direction is always conserved.

## Growth dynamics
The growth dynamics are modelled by a series of discrete events. These are

1. Deposition/ ablation of material
...The deposition occurs frequently with a deposition rate f (typically 1-3 Hz) (i.e., after a time n T = n/f). A number N of ABO<sub>3</sub> unit cells is added to the surface randomly (i.e., a<sub>i,j</sub> = a<sub>i,j</sub> + 1 if u < 1/N, where u is a random number between 0 and 1)

2. Diffusion of material
...The diffusion on the surface is described by nearest-neighbour (NN) hopping of unit cells of ABO<sub>3</sub>. The hopping rate h<sub>i,j</sub> is the product of an attempt rate h<sub>0</sub> and an Arrhenius-type probability of success per attempt. The activation energy E<sub>i,j</sub> is determined by a site-independent surface energy barrier E<sub>S</sub>, a nearest-neighbour binding energy barrier E<sub>B</sub> and the number of nearest-neighbours n<sub>i,j</sub> at site (i,j): E<sub>i,j</sub> = E<sub>S</sub> + n<sub>i,j</sub> E<sub>B</sub>. The direction of hopping is random.

3. Evaporation of material
...If the surface exhibits a BO<sub>2</sub>-termination it can locally convert to an AO-termiantion (i.e., a<sub>i,j</sub> = a<sub>i,j</sub> - 0.5). The AO-termination is considered thermodynamically stable. Hence, the evaporation rate is given by:
e<sub>i,j</sub> =
