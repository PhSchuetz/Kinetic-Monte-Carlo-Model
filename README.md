# Kinetic-Monte-Carlo-Model
This is a simple Kinetic-Monte-Carlo model I extended such that it incorporates the volatilization of an unstable surface layer during Pulsed Laser Deposition of ternary perovskite oxides.

The basic idea of the Kinetic-Monte-Carlo simulation was adopted from the following publications:
